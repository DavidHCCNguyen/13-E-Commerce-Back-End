Based on the folder and file structure you provided, here's an overview of the purpose of each folder and file:

- `config`: Contains the `connection.js` file which sets up the database connection using Sequelize.

- `db`: Contains the `schema.sql` file which defines the database schema.

- `models`: Contains the Sequelize model files that define the database tables and their associations. This folder includes `Category.js`, `Product.js`, `ProductTag.js`, and `Tag.js` files.

- `routes`: Contains the API route files for categories, products, and tags. This folder includes `category-routes.js`, `product-routes.js`, and `tag-routes.js` files. The `index.js` file in this folder is used to combine and export all the route files.

- `seeds`: Contains the seed data files used to populate the database with initial data. This folder may also include a `.env.EXAMPLE` file that serves as an example for the environment variable configuration.

- `.gitignore`: A file that specifies which files and folders should be ignored by Git version control.

- `package.json`: The project's package configuration file that includes dependencies, scripts, and other metadata.

- `server.js`: The main server file where the Express.js server is set up and started. This is also where the Sequelize models are synced with the MySQL database.

## Starting

- `Set up the project:`
Create a new directory for your project.
Initialize a new npm project using npm init.
Install the required dependencies, including Express, Sequelize, and MySQL2.

- `Configure the database:`
Create a .env file in the root of your project.
Add the following environment variables to the .env file:
DB_NAME (database name)
DB_USER (MySQL username)
DB_PASSWORD (MySQL password)
Create a config/config.js file to define the database configuration using the environment variables.

- `Define the Sequelize models:`
Create a models directory to store your model definitions.
Create four model files: Category.js, Product.js, Tag.js, and ProductTag.js.
Define the models according to the provided requirements using Sequelize.
Set up the associations between the models as specified.

- `Create the API routes:`
Create the necessary route files: product-routes.js, tag-routes.js, and category-routes.js.
Import the required models into the route files.
Implement the CRUD operations for each route using Sequelize methods.
Make sure to handle errors and send appropriate responses.

- `Seed the database:`
Create a seeds directory to store your seed data.
Create seed files for each model to populate the database with test data.
Implement the seeding logic using Sequelize's bulkCreate method.

- `Sync Sequelize to the database on server start:`
In the server.js file, import the Sequelize models and the database configuration.
Add code to sync the Sequelize models with the MySQL database using sequelize.sync({ force: false }).
Start the server and ensure that the models are synced to the database.

- `Test the routes:`
Use a tool like Insomnia or Postman to test the API routes.
Send requests to the routes to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.
Verify that the responses and database operations are as expected.

- `Create a walkthrough video:`
Record a video that demonstrates the functionality of your e-commerce site's backend.
Show how the routes work, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
Make sure to cover all the acceptance criteria mentioned in the user story.
Upload the video to a video hosting platform (e.g., YouTube) and obtain a shareable link.

- `Update the project's README:`
Include the link to the walkthrough video in the README file.
Provide instructions on how to run the project and test the API routes.
